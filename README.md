# SOLID PRINCIPLES WITH SIMPLE EXAMPLES

## Description

This repository contains simple examples of SOLID principles.
SOLID is an acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and
maintainable.

## SOLID Principles Summary

### **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**

    - A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.

### **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**

    - You should be able to extend a class's behavior, without modifying it.

### **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**

    - Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes.

### **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**

    - Make fine grained interfaces that are client specific. So that clients only need to know about the methods that are of interest to them.

### **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**

    - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
